    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-4 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center">
        I'm a Software Engineer, graduated from The Ohio State University -
        Columbus. I was born and raised in Columbus Ohio and I have a passion
        for technology and software development. I excel in problem solving and
        I am always looking for new challenges to tackle. In my free time I love
        to rock climb and go on climbing trips with my friends. I also enjoy
        biking, working out, and listening to music. I also have started
        watching One Piece in Summer 2024 and have been really enjoying it. My
        passion for software development has led me to create this portfolio to
        learn Angular and showcase my projects.
